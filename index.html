	<h3>In addition to screenplay, there are various new comic books that supplement the MCU. <nav><a href="comicbooks.html">You can find the list of comic books here.</a></nav>

	<h3><i>There is a Wikia with all the information available. It has everything found here and<nav><a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_Wiki">MUCH MORE.</a></nav></i></h3>
	<p>When viewing the HTML elements and udnerstanding the text, it baffles me. the text shows a simple foundation, yet complicated functions on those foundations. The structure can make a novice like me understand it to an extent. That is a very, very good thing and it shows the developer who worked on this website wanted to maintain it if needed. </p>
	<br>
	<p>This website utilize many of the codes that I used above. The Wikia code is a much more complicated version of what I have. They use several tables with many different functions for formatting. The website also have a header with multiple links above. I noticed that there are polls used on the right hand side, which utlize many input types. I'd like to know what class does, since they have that thing everything. I'm assuming it changes it to a type of some sort. However, some of the class have unique names. </p>
